So yeah, the Muisca come with an alternate color (White Background, Golden Foreground). This is not the main color because it can conflict with many mods' color 
scheme, specially that of a Kingdom of Jerusalem mod.

In order to use the alternate color, only replace MuiscaCivilization.xml with the another one found in XML\Civilization. Enjoy!
