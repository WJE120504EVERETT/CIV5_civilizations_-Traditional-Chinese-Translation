			<Text>During the period of its existence, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was by area the world’s largest country. It was also one of the most diverse, with more than 100 distinct nationalities living within its borders. The majority of the population, however, was made up of East Slavs (Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians); these groups together made up more than two-thirds of the total population in the late 1980s.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At its greatest extent, between 1946 and 1991 (the figures and descriptions given below refer to this period), the U.S.S.R. covered some 8,650,000 square miles (22,400,000 square kilometres), seven times the area of India and two and one-half times that of the United States. The country occupied nearly one-sixth of the Earth’s land surface, including the eastern half of Europe and roughly the northern third of Asia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The U.S.S.R. extended more than 6,800 miles (10,900 kilometres) from east to west, covering 11 of the world’s 24 time zones. The most westerly point was on the Baltic Sea, near Kaliningrad; the easternmost was Cape Dezhnev on the Bering Strait, nearly halfway around the world. From north to south the U.S.S.R. extended some 2,800 miles from Cape Chelyuskin to Kushka on the Afghan border. Nearly half the territory of the U.S.S.R. was north of 60° N, at the same latitude as Alaska, Baffin Island, and Greenland.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition to having the world’s longest coastline, the U.S.S.R. had the longest frontiers. To the north the country was bounded by the seas of the Arctic Ocean, and to the east were the seas of the Pacific. On the south the U.S.S.R. was bordered by North Korea, Mongolia, China, Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey. On the southern frontier there were three seas: the Caspian Sea, the world’s largest inland sea, as well as the almost completely landlocked Black Sea and Sea of Azov. Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Finland, and Norway lay to the west.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The U.S.S.R. was the successor to the Russian Empire of the tsars. Following the 1917 Revolution, four socialist republics were established on the territory of the former empire: the Russian and Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republics and the Ukrainian and Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republics. On Dec. 30, 1922, these constituent republics established the U.S.S.R. Additional union republics (Soviet Socialist Republics) were set up in subsequent years: the Turkmen and Uzbek S.S.R.’s in 1924, the Tadzhik S.S.R. in 1929, and the Kazakh and Kirgiz S.S.R.’s in 1936. In that year the Transcaucasian Republic was abolished and its territory was divided between three new republics: the Armenian, Azerbaijan, and Georgian S.S.R.’s. In 1940 the Karelo-Finnish, Moldavian, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian S.S.R.’s were established. The Karelo-Finnish S.S.R. became an autonomous republic in 1956, leaving a total of 15 union republics (soyuznye respubliki). In addition to these, the U.S.S.R. as of 1990 was made up of 20 autonomous republics (avtonomnye respubliki), 8 autonomous provinces (avtonomnye oblasti), 10 autonomous districts (avtonomnye okruga), 6 regions (kraya), and 114 provinces (oblasti).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Under the constitution adopted in the 1930s and modified down to October 1977, the political foundation of the U.S.S.R. was formed by the Soviets (Councils) of People’s Deputies. These existed at all levels of the administrative hierarchy, with the Soviet Union as a whole under the nominal control of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., located in Moscow. This body had two chambers—the Soviet of the Union, with 750 members elected on a single-member constituency basis; and the Soviet of Nationalities, with 750 members representing the various political divisions: 32 from each union republic, 11 from each autonomous republic, 5 from each autonomous region, and 1 from each autonomous district. In elections to these bodies, the voters were rarely given any choice of candidate other than those presented by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), which, until the amendment of Article 6 of the constitution in March 1990, was the “leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political system.” In theory, all legislation required the approval of both chambers of the Supreme Soviet; in practice, all decisions were made by the small group known as the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, itself strongly influenced by the Politburo of the CPSU, and were unanimously approved by the deputies. The role of the soviets in the individual republics and other territories was primarily to put into effect the decisions made by the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The political system was thus authoritarian and highly centralized, and this also applied to the economic system. The economic foundation of the U.S.S.R. was “Socialist ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange,” and the economy of the entire country was controlled by a series of five-year plans that set targets for all forms of production.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dramatic changes, both political and economic, occurred during the late 1980s and early ’90s, ushered in by the adoption of perestroika (“restructuring”) and glasnost (“openness”). On the economic side the planned, highly centralized command economy was to be replaced by the progressive introduction of elements of a market economy, a change that proved difficult to achieve and was accompanied by declining production in many sectors and increasing distribution problems. In the political sphere, amendments to the constitution in 1988 replaced the old Supreme Soviet with the Congress of People’s Deputies of the U.S.S.R. The new congress had 2,250 members; one-third of these were elected on a constituency basis, one-third represented the political territories (as in the old Supreme Soviet), and the remaining third came from “all-union social organizations” such as the trade unions, the CPSU, and the Academy of Sciences. Voters were presented with a choice of candidates, and many non-Communists were elected. The Congress of People’s Deputies elected a new Supreme Soviet of 542 members and also chose the chairman of that body, who was to be the executive president of the U.S.S.R. Congresses of People’s Deputies were also established in each republic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These congresses could be legitimately described as parliaments, and they engaged in vigorous debate over the economic and political future of the country. From 1989, conflicts developed between the parliament of the U.S.S.R. and those of the individual republics, mainly over the respective powers of the centre (the U.S.S.R. government) and the republics. These conflicts were exacerbated by the resurgence of ethnic nationalism and increasing demands for autonomy and even for full independence. Following the abortive coup of August 1991, in which the CPSU was heavily implicated, the party itself was abolished.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By December 1991 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had virtually ceased to exist, and the future of its territories and peoples was uncertain. Three republics—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—had achieved complete independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states, and several others were demanding independence. Attempts were made, led by Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union, to establish a new “Union of Sovereign States” with some degree of integration in foreign policy, defense, and economic affairs, but agreement among the remaining 12 republics was not achieved. Whatever the legal position, the union republics had begun to act as if they were sovereign states and were negotiating with each other, bypassing the vestigial central government. This process culminated on Dec. 8, 1991, in the signing of an agreement between the three Slav republics of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus for the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), with an agreed common policy for foreign affairs and defense. The CIS later came to include all the remaining republics except Georgia, but great difficulty was experienced in arriving at agreed policies. The future thus remained uncertain, but there could be no disagreement with the statement by the leaders of the Commonwealth that “the U.S.S.R. has ceased to exist as a geopolitical reality.”</Text>

			<Text>Few events have shaped contemporary history as profoundly as the Russian Revolution and the Communist revolutions that followed it. Each one of them was made in the name of V. I. Lenin, his doctrines, and his political practices. Contemporary thinking about world affairs has been greatly influenced by Lenin's impetus and contributions. From Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points to today's preoccupation with wars of national liberation, imperialism, and decolonization, many important issues of contemporary social science were first raised or disseminated by Lenin; even some of the terms he used have entered into everyone's vocabulary. The very opposition to Lenin often takes Leninist forms.</Text>

			<Text>V. I. Lenin was born in Simbirsk (today Ulianovsk) on April 10 (Old Style), 1870. His real family name was Ulianov, and his father, Ilia Nikolaevich Ulianov, was a high official in the czarist educational bureaucracy who had risen into the nobility. Vladimir received the conventional education given to the sons of the Russian upper class but turned into a radical dissenter. One impetus to his conversion doubtless was the execution by hanging of his older brother Alexander in 1887; Alexander and a few associates had conspired to assassinate the Emperor. Lenin graduated from secondary school with high honors, enrolled at Kazan University, but was expelled after participating in a demonstration. He retired to the family estate but was permitted to continue his studies in absentia. He obtained a law degree in 1891.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When, in 1893, he moved to St. Petersburg, Lenin was already a Marxist and a revolutionary by profession, joining like-minded intellectuals in study groups, writing polemical pamphlets and articles, and seeking to organize workers. The St. Petersburg Union for the Struggle for the Liberation of Labor, which Lenin helped create, was one of the important nuclei of the Russian Marxist movement. The most important work from this period is a lengthy pamphlet, "What Are the 'Friends of the People,' and How Do They Fight against Social-Democracy?" In it Lenin presents the essentials of his entire outlook.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1897 Lenin was arrested, spent some months in jail, and was finally sentenced to 3 years of exile in the Siberian village of Shushenskoe. He was joined there by a fellow Marxist, Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya, whom he married in 1898. In his Siberian exile he produced a major study of the Russian economy, The Development of Capitalism in Russia, in which he sought to demonstrate that, despite its backwardness, the economy of his country had definitely transformed itself into a capitalist one. If Lenin had produced nothing else than this learned though controversial work, he would today be known as one of the leading Russian economists of his period.</Text>

			<Text>Not long after his release from Siberia in the summer of 1900, Lenin moved to Europe, where he spent most of the next 17 years, moving from one country to another at frequent intervals, periods of feverish activity alternating with those of total frustration. His first step was to join the editorial board of Iskra (>The Spark), then the central newspaper of Russian Marxism, where he served together with the top leaders of the movement. After parting from Iskra, he edited a succession of papers of his own and contributed to other socialist journals. His journalistic activity was closely linked with organizational work, partly because the underground organizational network within Russia to some extent revolved around the distribution of clandestine literature.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Organizational activity, in turn, was linked with the selection and training of personnel. For some time Lenin conducted a training school for Russian revolutionaries at Longjumeau, a suburb of Paris. A perennial problem was that of financing the movement and its leaders' activities in their European exile. Lenin personally could usually depend on financial support from his mother; but her pension could not pay for his political activities. Much of the early history of Russian Marxism can be understood only in the light of these pressing money problems.</Text>

			<Text>A Marxist movement had developed in Russia only during the last decade of the 19th century as a response to the rapid growth of industry, urban centers, and a proletariat. Its first intellectual spokesmen were people who had turned away from populism (narodnichestvo), which they regarded as a failure. Instead of relying on the peasantry, they placed their hopes on the workers as the revolutionary class. Rejecting the village socialism preached by the Narodniks, they opted for industrialization, modernization, and Westernization. Their immediate aim they declared to be a bourgeois revolution which would transform Russia into a democratic republic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In accepting this revolutionary scenario, Lenin added the important proviso that hegemony in the coming bourgeois revolution should remain with the proletariat as the most consistently revolutionary of all classes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the same time, Lenin, more than most Marxists, made a clear distinction between the workers' movement, on the one hand, and the theoretical contribution to be made by intellectuals, on the other. Of the two, he considered the theoretical contribution the more important, the workers' movement being a merely spontaneous reaction to capitalist exploitation, whereas theory was an expression of consciousness, meaning science and rationality. Throughout his life Lenin insisted that consciousness must maintain leadership over spontaneity for revolutionary Marxism to succeed. This implies that the intellectual leaders must prepare the proletariat for its political tasks and must guide it in its action. Leadership and hierarchy thus become key concepts in the Leninist vocabulary, and the role and structure of the party must conform to this conception. The party is seen as the institutionalization of true consciousness. It must turn into the general staff of the revolution, subjecting the working class and indeed all its own members to command and discipline.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lenin expressed these ideas in his important book What's To Be Done? (1902), the title of the work expressing his indebtedness to Nikolai Chernyshevsky. When, in 1903, the leaders of Russian Marxism met for the first important party congress, formally the Second Congress, these ideas clashed head on with the conception of a looser, more democratic workers' party advanced by Lenin's old friend luli Martov. This disagreement over the nature and organization of the party was complicated by numerous other conflicts of view, and from its first important congress Russian Marxism emerged split into two factions. The one led by Lenin called itself the majority faction (bolsheviki); the other got stuck with the name of minority faction (mensheviki). Lenin's reaction to the split was expressed in his pamphlet "One Step Forward—Two Steps Back," published in 1904.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mensheviks and Bolsheviks disagreed not only over organizational questions but also over most other political problems, including the entire conception of a Marxist program for Russia and the methods to be employed by the party. Bolshevism, in general, stresses the need for revolution and the futility of incremental reforms; it emphasizes the goals of Marxism rather than the process, with its timetable, by which Marx thought the new order was to be reached; in comparison to menshevism it is impatient, pragmatic, and tough-minded.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Revolution of 1905 surprised all Russian revolutionary leaders, including the Bolsheviks. Lenin managed to return to Russia only in November, when the defeat of the revolution was a virtual certainty. But he was among the last to give up. For many more months he urged his followers to renew their revolutionary enthusiasm and activities and to prepare for an armed uprising. For some time afterward the technology of revolutionary warfare became the focus of his interest. His militancy was expressed in an anti-Menshevik pamphlet published in 1905, "Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The major impact of the aborted revolution and its aftermath was a decided change in Lenin's attitude toward the peasantry. Lenin came to recognize it as a class in its own right—not just as a rural proletariat—with its own interests, and as a valuable ally for the revolutionary proletariat. His pamphlet "The Agrarian Question in the Russian Revolution of 1905-7" presents these new views in systematic fashion.</Text>

			<Text>In the 12 years between the Revolution of 1905 and that of 1917, bolshevism, which had begun as a faction within the Russian Social-Democratic Workers party, gradually emerged as an independent party that had cut its ties with all other Russian Marxists. The process entailed prolonged and bitter polemics against Mensheviks as well as against all those who worked for a reconciliation of the factions. It involved fights over funds, struggles for control of newspapers, the development of rival organizations, and meetings of rival congresses. Disputes concerned many questions about the goals and strategies of the movement, the role of national liberation movements within the Marxist party, and also philosophic controversies. Lenin's contribution to this last topic was published in 1909, Materialism and Empirio-criticism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since about 1905 the international socialist movement had begun also to discuss the possibility of a major war breaking out. In its congresses of 1907 and 1912, resolutions were passed which condemned such wars in advance and pledged the parties of the proletariat not to support them. Lenin had wanted to go further than that. He had urged active opposition to the war effort and a transformation of any war into a proletarian revolution. He called his policy "revolutionary defeatism." When World War I broke out, most socialist leaders in the countries involved supported the war effort. For Lenin, this was proof that he and they shared no aims or views. The break between the two schools of Marxism had become irreconcilable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the war Lenin lived in Switzerland. He attended several conferences of radical socialists opposed to the war or even agreeing with Lenin's revolutionary defeatism. He read extensively on the Marxist theory of state and wrote a first draft for a book on the subject, The State and Revolution. He also immersed himself in literature dealing with contemporary world politics and wrote a book which may, in the long run, be his most important one, Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916), in which Marxism is effectively made applicable to the 20th century. By the beginning of 1917 he had fits of despondency and wrote to a close friend that he despaired of ever witnessing another revolution. This was about a month before the fall of czarism.</Text>

			<Text>It took a good deal of negotiation and courage for Lenin and a group of like-minded Russian revolutionaries to travel from Switzerland back to Russia through enemy country (Germany). Much has been made of Lenin's negotiations with an enemy power and of the fact that some Bolshevik activities were supported financially by German intelligence agencies. There is no convincing evidence, however, which might show that acceptance of funds from objectionable sources made Lenin an agent of these sources in anyway. And from his point of view the source of aid was immaterial; what counted was the use to which it was put.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The man who returned to Russia in the famed "sealed train" in the spring of 1917 was of medium height, quite bald, except for the back of his head, with a reddish beard. The features of his face were arresting—slanted eyes that looked piercingly at others, and high cheek-bones under a towering forehead. The rest of his appearance was deceptively ordinary: a man of resolute movements clad quite conservatively in a middle-class suit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Versed in many languages, Lenin spoke Russian with a slight speech defect but was a powerful orator in small groups as well as before mass audiences. A tireless worker, he made others work tirelessly. Self-effacing, he sought to compel his collaborators to devote every ounce of their energy to the revolutionary task at hand. He was impatient with any extraneous activities, including small talk and abstract theoretical discussions. Indeed, he was suspicious of intellectuals and felt most at home in the company of simple folk. Having been brought up in the tradition of the Russian nobility, Lenin loved hunting, hiking, horseback riding, boating, mush-rooming, and the outdoor life in general. He sought to steel himself by systematic physical exercise and generally forbade himself those hobbies which he considered time-wasting or corrupting: chess, music, and companionship. While his life-style was that of a dedicated professional revolutionary, his tastes in art, morals, and manners were rather conventional.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once he had returned to Russia, Lenin worked feverishly and relentlessly to utilize the revolutionary situation that had been created by the fall of czarism so as to convert it into a proletarian revolution which would bring his own party into power. These were the crucial 6 months of his life, but space does not permit a detailed account of his activities in the period. The result of his activities is well known: Opinions in Russia quickly became more and more polarized. Moderate forces found themselves less and less able to maintain even the pretense of control. In the end, the so-called provisional government, then headed by Kerensky, simply melted away, and power literally fell into the hands of the Bolsheviks. As a result of this so-called October Revolution, Lenin found himself not only the leader of his party but also the chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (equivalent to premier minister) of the newly proclaimed Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.</Text>

			<Text>During the first years of Lenin's rule as dictator of Russia, the major task he faced was that of establishing his and his party's authority in the country. Most of his policies can be understood in this light, even though he alienated some elements in the population while satisfying others. Examples are the expropriation of landholdings for distribution to the peasants, the separate peace treaty with Germany, and the nationalization of banks and industrial establishments.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]From 1918 to 1921 a fierce civil war raged which the Bolsheviks finally won against seemingly overwhelming odds. During the civil war Lenin tightened his party's dictatorship and eventually eliminated all rival parties from the political arena. A spirited defense of his dictatorship can be found in his "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky" (1918), in which he answers criticism from some more moderate Marxists. Lenin had to create an entirely new political system with the help of inexperienced personnel; he was heading a totally exhausted economy and had to devise desperate means for mobilizing people for work. Simultaneously he created the Third (Communist) International and vigorously promoted the spread of the revolution to other countries; and meanwhile he had to cope with dissent among his own party comrades, some of whom criticized him from the left. The pamphlet "Left-wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" is a response to this criticism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When the civil war had been won and the regime established firmly, the economy was ruined, and much of the population was bitterly opposed to the regime. At this point Lenin reversed many of his policies and instituted a trenchant reform, called the New Economic Policy. It signified a temporary retreat from the goal of establishing communism at once and a resolve to make do with the social forces available: the Communist party declared itself ready to coexist and cooperate with features of the past, such as free enterprise, capitalist institutions, and capitalist states across the borders. For the time being, the Soviet economy would be a mixture of capitalist and socialist features. The stress of the party's policies would be on economic reconstruction and on the education of a peasant population for life in the 20th century. In the long run, Lenin hoped that both these policies would make the blessings of socialism obvious to all, so that the country would gradually grow into socialism. The wariness, the caution, the fear of excessive haste and impatience which Lenin showed in the years 1921-1923 are expressed only inadequately in the last few articles he wrote, such as "On Cooperation," "How We Must Reorganize the Workers and Peasants Inspectorate," and "Better Less but Better."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1918 an assassin wounded Lenin; he recovered but may have suffered some lasting damage. On May 26, 1922, he suffered a serious stroke from which he recovered after some weeks, only to suffer a second stroke on December 16. He was so seriously incapacitated that he could participate in political matters only intermittently and feebly. An invalid, he lived in a country home at Gorki, near Moscow, where he died on Jan. 21, 1924. His body was preserved and is on view in the Lenin Mausoleum outside the walls of the Moscow Kremlin.</Text>

Though born into wealth, you would instead turn to the cause of the working class, taking your place as leader of the Bolshevik Party in a pledge to forge a nation dictated by men of the soil. A storm was brewing in the heart of mighty Russia, and the days of the Tsars were drawing to a close. With the Russian Revolution in 1917, Nicholas II was overthrown, and the monarchy which had raised Russia for centuries was finally undone. With you at the helm of a new, socialist Republic, Russia would begin its journey into a communist modernity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dauntless revolutionary, once again the fires of change must be ignited by your championship. The will of the proletariat lies broken beneath the crowns of autocrats and it demands your determination to inspire strength. Can you bring forth the will of your comrades against their slavery?

			<Text>列甯出生于辛比爾斯克（今烏裏揚諾夫斯克）的壹個中産階級家庭，在兄長亞曆山大·烏裏揚諾夫于1887年遭到沙皇處決後，他決定接受革命社會主義的政治立場。由于參與反對俄羅斯帝國沙皇專制制度的抗議活動，導致他遭喀山大學除名，他在隨後幾年則專注于法律學位上。1893年，他搬到聖彼得堡，成爲俄國社會民主工黨高級幹部，主張馬克思主義。1897年，他因爲被控煽動叛亂而遭逮捕，至舒申斯科耶度過長達3年的流放生涯，期間與娜傑日達·克魯普斯卡娅結婚。他在流放結束後搬往西歐，透過出版而成爲著名的政黨理論家。1903年，他在俄國社會民主工黨意識形態分裂中扮演著關鍵角色，領導布爾什維克對抗尤裏·馬爾托夫的孟什維克。他鼓舞了1905年俄國革命的爆發，而後則發起活動，以讓第壹次世界大戰轉爲整個歐洲的無産階級革命；作爲馬克思主義者，他相信這將推翻資本主義生産方式、且由社會主義社會替代。1917年，俄國二月革命推翻沙皇並建立俄國臨時政府，列甯則返回俄羅斯。之後他領導發動十月革命，使布爾什維克推翻新政權，建立蘇維埃俄國。</Text>

			<Text>革命成功後，列甯領導的布爾什維克組成人民委員會（最高行政機關），部分權力則由民選的全俄羅斯蘇維埃代表大會擁有。新政府曾爲俄國立憲會議進行選舉，但隨後遭到廢除。在與同盟國簽署《布列斯特-立陶夫斯克條約》後，俄羅斯退出第壹次世界大戰，並承認非俄羅斯民族國家獨立。右派和左派團體共組反對布爾什維克的軍隊，但在1917年至1922年的俄國內戰中戰敗。盡管蘇俄政府決定重新分配農民、國家銀行與大型工業的土地，不過爲了應對戰爭破壞、饑荒與民衆暴動，列甯在1921年推行混合經濟體系的新經濟政策，以促進經濟成長。爲了設法推進世界革命，布爾什維克政權創辦第三國際，期間進行波蘇戰爭。1922年，蘇俄和鄰近國家簽署《蘇聯成立條約》，宣告蘇維埃社會主義共和國聯盟的成立。隨著健康越來越惡化，列甯對于其新當選總書記的約瑟夫·斯大林權力不斷增長，領導的中央組織局逐漸官僚化，以及格魯吉亞事件的問題表示反對，但最終未能扭轉局勢。1924年，他于高爾基列甯斯克逝世。</Text>

			<Text>列甯的觀點在很大程度上受到先前存在的思想影響，包括俄羅斯革命運動和俄羅斯馬克思主義理論變體，後者聚焦在馬克思和恩格斯著作如何適用于俄羅斯。不過即使身爲馬克思主義者，列甯也因而受到俄羅斯早期流行的社會主義思想流派影響，其中像是均田社會主義的民粹派[5]:173。相反地，他嘲笑同時期采納非馬克思主義哲學家、社會主義人士和社會學家看法的馬克思主義者。在《帝國主義是資本主義的最高階段》等理論著作中，他自己研究自己對于馬克思逝世後的資本主義發展的看法，認爲其已經抵達國家壟斷資本主義的新階段。而在1917年奪取政權前，他認爲雖然在俄羅斯經濟中仍然是農民階級占首要地位，但俄羅斯存在著壟斷資本主義的事實，意味著國家能充分發展物質而轉移到社會主義。</Text>

		<Text>1917年，政治意識的蓬勃發展、革命思想的巨大影響力、及政府體制的軟弱與無能（其在參與壹次大戰後更爲衰弱），本應使俄羅斯皇帝尼古拉二世體認到致力于改革的必要性。事實上在1917年1月，喬治·布坎南爵士，英國駐俄國的使節，曾忠告皇帝“打破您與人民間的隔閡、重新取得他們的信任”。但尼古拉否絕了布坎南的建言。許多俄國人民對皇帝尼古拉二世的獨裁及其政府的腐敗與過時聚怨已深。他們認爲皇帝不理解俄國人民的需求與意願，而他們絕大多數是俄國惡劣的社會經濟條件的受害者。在社會方面，沙俄的農工業在其余歐洲之後處境穩健，農人與勞工仍握有少量開創良好發展的機會。以經濟的角度而言，俄國的廣泛通膨與糧食短缺促進了革命的形成。在軍事上，軍糧、後勤與軍備的不足，使俄國在壹次大戰期間蒙受慘重的損失；這更確信了俄國人民對尼古拉二世無能統治的觀點。最終，這些因素，伴隨著革命思想與運動的茁壯（特別是1905年血腥星期日大屠殺後之時），引發了俄國革命。</Text>

			<Text>在列甯作爲俄國獨裁者執政的最初幾年，他面臨的主要任務是在全國建立他和他的黨的權威。他的大多數政策都可以從這個角度來理解，盡管他疏遠了民衆中的壹些人，同時也滿足了另壹些人的要求。例如，征用土地分給農民、與德國簽訂單獨的和約、銀行和工業企業國有化等。在內戰期間，列甯加強了黨的獨裁統治，並最終將所有敵對黨派趕出了政治舞台。列甯在《無産階級革命和叛徒考茨基》（1918　年）壹書中爲自己的獨裁統治進行了有力的辯護，他在書中回答了壹些較爲溫和的馬克思主義者的批評。列甯必須在缺乏經驗的人員的幫助下建立壹個全新的政治制度；他領導的是壹個完全枯竭的經濟，必須想出絕招來動員人們工作。與此同時，他創建了第三（共産）國際，並大力推動革命向其他國家的傳播；與此同時，他還必須應對黨內同志的不同意見，其中壹些人從左翼對他進行了批評。　[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]當內戰取得勝利、政權穩固建立之後，經濟卻遭到了破壞，許多人都強烈反對這個政權。這時，列甯推翻了他的許多政策，實行了壹項嚴厲的改革，即新經濟政策。這意味著從立即建立共産主義的目標上暫時後退，並決心利用現有的社會力量：共産黨宣布准備與過去的特征，如自由企業、資本主義機構和跨國界的資本主義國家共存與合作。目前，蘇聯經濟將是資本主義和社會主義特征的混合體。黨的政策重點將放在經濟重建和教育農民適應　20　世紀的生活上。從長遠來看，列甯希望這兩項政策能夠使所有人都能明顯感受到社會主義的好處，從而使國家逐步發展成爲社會主義國家。列甯在1921-1923年間所表現出的戒心、謹慎、對過分急躁和急于求成的恐懼，在他所寫的最後幾篇文章中，如《論合作》、《我們必須怎樣改組工農檢查團》和《甯可少些，也要好》等，都得到了充分的表達。</Text>
